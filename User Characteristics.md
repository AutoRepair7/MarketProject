### User Stories
Mostly I will use the observing method to see how the employees interact with the product, and then use the same method to observe how the users/customers interact with the product. 

Write down their moves and important key-points throughout the observation.

Draw a small sketch of what I saw in the observation.

The most important moments that describe a requirement/need will be written down on post-it notes.

After they are gathered, I will group them and document them into a task board.
