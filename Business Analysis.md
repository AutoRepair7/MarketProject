# 1. Introduction
AutoRepair Inc. hopes to use their passion for cars to help customers receive their cars in perfect condition. If a car is trusted into their service, you can rest assured that it will be well loved and sent back to you as good as new.
   ## 1. Business Purpose
   AutoRepair Inc. wishes to expand their network and let the public see what they are working on. They have been working locally since they started the company back in    2018, and they have found it difficult to spread the knowledge of their company. A website is an easy and quick way of spreading the word while allowing people from all parts of the state to check on their work through their devices.
   ## 2. Business Scope
   a) Business Domain: Car services. AutoRepair Inc. can be described as being focused on mechanic services. The customer will come with their car and describe the problem or paint job that they need, and the mechanics/technicians will deliver the required service. The business domain can be called mechanic services or, more broadly speaking, car services. Because AutoRepair Inc. not only fixes cars, but also offers paint jobs and custom designs, I will call the business domain: car services.
   b) Instead of separating their work into multiple divisions, since they overlap constantly, they have decided to keep it simple. There are two divisions in AutoRepair Inc.
