# 1. Introduction
   ## 1. Business Purpose
   Perfect AutoRepair wishes to expand their network and let the public see what they are working on. They have been working locally since they started the company back in 2018, and they have found it difficult to spread the knowledge of their company. A website is an easy and quick way of spreading the word while allowing people from all parts of the state to check on their work through their devices.
   ## 2. Business Scope
   a) Business Domain: Car services. Perfect AutoRepair can be described as being focused on mechanic services. The customer will come with their car and describe the problem or paint job that they need, and the mechanics/technicians will deliver the required service. The business domain can be called mechanic services or, more broadly speaking, car services. Because Perfect AutoRepair not only fixes cars, but also offers paint jobs and custom designs, I will call the business domain: car services.
   
   b) Instead of separating their work into multiple divisions, since they overlap constantly, they have decided to keep it simple. There are two divisions in Perfect AutoRepair. The first division deals with the repair of cars and pieces. The customer comes in and explains their needs. If they are not sure, the mechanic can perform a checkup to try and find the problem. The second division deals with paint and design services. A customer can order a painting service, or specific design they want on their car. Many times when a customer wants a car fixed, they will opt for the paint service as well. The mechanich, if experienced enough, can perform that job as well. These two divisions are closely placed to one another on a small workshop.
   
   c) The system being developed is a general website for the company. It will display information and updates about the company and their work. It has their contact information and address to allow and encourage communication. It will have an album for images, so potential customers can see and expect what their services could look like. Lastly, it will have a waitlist in case that all active mechanics and technicians are booked. A customer or potential customer will be able to check-in and put themselves on the list, while seeing in real-time when they finish a job and take the next one, until it is their turn. They want to make this system part of a customer service division.
   
   ## 3. Overview 
   There are two main divisions in Perfect AutoRepair : The mechanic division: where customers will bring their broken cars to be fixed, and the paint division: where customers get paint jobs and custom designs for their cars. Often times, these two divisions will overlap, since a customer usually likes to order a paint job when their car is fixed. A mechanic and a technician can often work together to finish the same job. Perfect AutoRepair wants to expand a third division to take care of networking and customer service, where they will work with the website. Until now, they have not had a specified branch to take care of customer service, but the hope is to create a new division to do so.

# 3. Business Management Requirements
   ## 1. Business environment
   Customer satisfaction is a priority, as customers usually like to recommend the service to others if they are satisfied. Because of the high influx of cars on the streets every day, the car repair / paint market will usually remain stable enough that operations can go on as usual. Some other factors that should be taken into consideration are the increasing cost of materials, tools, and equipement necessary for daily operations. Newer car models require new training to work well with the new technology. 
   
   ## 2. Mission, goals, and objectives
   Perfect AutoRepair hopes to use their passion for cars to help customers receive their cars in perfect condition. If a car is trusted into their service, you can rest assured that it will be well loved and sent back to you as good as new.
   
   The goal of the proposed system is to give the company more visibility, to allow people from everywhere to connect with them and their work. Customers will be able to follow their work closely and in real-time.

   ## 4. Information environment
   a) project portfolio - all projects in perfect AutoRepair usually pursue the same business goal: to fix the customer's car to perfection. The owner, who also works as a mechanic/technician, will gather the other workers to plan for whatever next plan they have in mind. Usually, projects will be run by first finding what is needed from the proect, next it is defined, and the actors who are to take it to completion are decided. Projects often consist of the usual mechanic car fixing, painting, or finding specific car pieces necessary at special stores.  
   
   Some projects:
   renovate workshop 
   create new paint room
   
   b) long term system plan:
   increase company awarness
